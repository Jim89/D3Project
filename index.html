	<h1>Top Athlete Performance</h1>
	<p class="introduction"> This work was created for BS1807 - Visualisation as part of the MSc. in Business Analytics at Imperial College London.	The creator blogs <a href="http://www.thedatagent.com/">here</a> and can be found on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/leach_jim">here</a>. The two charts show related views of athlete performance. The left (bar) chart simple shows total medals (for those athletes who have won at least four). The right (scatter) chart shows a measure of athlete efficiency by comparing total medals with total appearances. Efficiency provides a different esimate of athlete performance. Positions closer to the top left of the chart are more efficient than those in the bottom right.</p>
